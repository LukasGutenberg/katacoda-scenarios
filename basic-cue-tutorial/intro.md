## Introduction

Welcome to this tutorial for CUE, the configuration language that aims to make data formats such as JSON and YAML easier to work with. JSON is easy for machines to process, but it is a hassle for humans to deal with. YAML has the opposite problem, and CUE is an alternative that aims to combine the strengths of both. CUE is considered a superset of JSON as the former can read and represent all of the latter, while the other way around is not true. Although CUE is not a superset of YAML, it can validate and import YAML files.


## Intended Learning Outcomes

This tutorial is intended to teach the basics of the CUE configuration language that will open up people to using and learning more about it.

You will learn the following in this tutorial:
1. How to import a JSON or YAML file into a CUE file that is ready for editing.
2. How to use basic functions in a CUE file to implement data restrictions and limiting boilerplate.
3. How to export a CUE file into either a JSON or a YAML file.

## Recommended Prerequisite Skills

This tutorial is aimed at people with some experience with programming and it is recommended to be somewhat familiar with the following:
- Bash
- JSON
- YAML (not necessary)

## About this tutorial
The tutorial will install CUE in the background when you start it, but it can take some time so wait with any commands until the file explorer stops updating.
