## Introduction

Welcome to this tutorial for CUE, the configuration language that aims to make data formats such as JSON and YAML easier to work with. JSON is easy for machines to process, but it is a hassle for humans to deal with. YAML has the opposite problem, and CUE is an alternative that aims to combine the strengths of both. CUE is considered a superset of JSON as the former can read and represent all of the latter, while the other way around is not true. Although CUE is not a superset of YAML, it can validate and import YAML files.
