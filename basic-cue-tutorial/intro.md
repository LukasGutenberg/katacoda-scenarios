## Introduction

Welcome to this tutorial for CUE, the configuration language that aims to make data formats such as JSON and YAML easier to work with. JSON is easy for machines to process, but it is a hassle for humans to deal with. YAML has the opposite problem, and CUE is an alternative that aims to combine the strengths of both. CUE can read all JSON and YAML, and represent them, while the other way around is not true. It can also export files in all the three formats, CUE, JSON and YAML.
